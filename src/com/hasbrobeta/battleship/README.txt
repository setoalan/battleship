The bitbucket repository is public.  In order to work in the team setting, 
one must checkout the fork and also have permission to work with the 
ASK scanning library submodule.

To use, build it on an Android SDT and run the application on an Android tablet to 
maximize the graphics.  We have used a 2013 Nexus 7.  HAVE FUN.
